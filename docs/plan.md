**InvoiceNest AI-Powered Build Guide**
A comprehensive step-by-step plan for building the core v1 of InvoiceNest. Each step includes actionable tasks, time estimates, dependencies, and suggested tools/frameworks.

---

## Development Workflow

### TDD (Test-Driven Development) Workflow
* For each new feature or fix:
  * Write a failing test first (Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend)
  * Implement minimal code to pass the test
  * Refactor code for clarity, performance, and compliance with standards
  * Repeat this cycle until the feature is complete

### Git Workflow
* **Branch Strategy**: feature/feature-name, bugfix/issue-description, hotfix/critical-fix
* **Commit Convention**: feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:
* **Pull Request**: Required for all changes, code review mandatory
* **Release Strategy**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

### Code Quality Standards
* **ESLint**: Enforce code style and catch potential errors
* **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
* **TypeScript**: Strict type checking
* **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for linting and testing
* **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for critical paths

## Testing Strategy for MVP

To ensure quality and maintain rapid development for the MVP, the following pragmatic testing strategy will be used:

### 1. Integration Tests for Core Flows
- Focus on integration tests for all API endpoints and main user flows (authentication, customer CRUD, invoice creation, payments, reports).
- These tests provide confidence that the system works end-to-end and catch real-world bugs that matter most for MVP users.

### 2. Unit Tests for Critical/Complex Logic
- Write unit tests for utility functions (date formatting, currency, calculations) and any business logic that is non-trivial or reused in multiple places.
- This ensures correctness and makes future refactoring safe.

### 3. Skip Unit Tests for Simple Controllers/Services
- For simple CRUD controllers/services that just delegate to other layers, rely on integration tests for coverage.
- Unit tests can be added later if/when the logic grows in complexity.

### Summary Table

| Layer         | Unit Test? | Integration Test? | MVP Recommendation         |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Utilities     | Yes        | No                | Yes (fast, easy)          |
| Controllers   | Optional   | Yes               | Integration only          |
| Services      | Optional   | Yes               | Integration only          |
| API Endpoints | No         | Yes               | Yes                       |

This approach balances speed, coverage, and maintainability for the MVP. As the project evolves, the testing strategy can be expanded to include more granular unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests as needed.
